This project aims on creating highly repeatable process for setting up k3s on Raspberry Pi's from flashing the cards to a cluster complete with persistent storage and observability (possibly other optional things in the future as well).

The name "two tauers" was coined by my colleague who introduced me to the value of &tau; = 2&pi;.
